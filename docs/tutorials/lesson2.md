# Web Demo
This web page visualizes reports for policy optimization of hosted
customer VMs.  Interested readers in more background for the exploration of
this task can continue to the [next lesson](lesson3.md).

## Running Example
This demonstration web page shows plots of predicted and historical resource
values for memory, CPU, and network throughput from actual customer VMs
running a firewall VNF.

Interact with the demo by selecting a different **Customer VM**,
changing the start or end date for analysis, or clicking on the
summarized graphs at the bottom of the page.

In future versions, these plotted graphs will be populated by a running
instance or by retrieving recent historical predictions and values from
a live database.

## Web Technologies
For interactions, this page uses open-source web technologies like
[bootstrap-3.3.7](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#download),
[AngularJS 1.6.1](https://angularjs.org/),
